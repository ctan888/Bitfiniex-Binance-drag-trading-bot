# Bitfiniex-Binance-drag-trading-bot

## I can only partially open this repo 
because I want to make it profitable. (Seriously, maybe when BTC go back to $20000)

### this project allow cryptocurrency investors to use a drag-flow graph to make their own trading strategy. By combining all those indicators and conditions I provided in a graph, they can generate their own python code to connect to Bitfiniex and Binance and trade!

### how do I implement this project
I hacked the react storm diagram repo to build this project. By parsing the serialized graph, I can generate python codes easily!

### how UI interface looks like
